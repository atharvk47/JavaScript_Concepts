// Template Literals use back-ticks (``) rather than the quotes ("") to define a string.

let text = `Hello World!`;
console.log(text);

// With template literals, you can use both single and double quotes inside a String. 

let subtext = `He's often called "Johnny"`;
console.log(subtext);

// Template literal can be used to escape single and double quotes.
